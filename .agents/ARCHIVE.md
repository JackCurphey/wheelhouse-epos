# ARCHIVE — Wheelhouse EPOS

Superseded resume-file content, kept verbatim. Nothing is deleted from the
project's history; when `.agents/STATUS.md` outgrows its 8,000-byte cap,
content moves here rather than being dropped. Decisions move to
`docs/decisions/` instead.

## Mark's original `.agents/STATUS.md`

Authored by Mark Curphey. Last updated `fa32b60`, 31 August 2026 (blob
`0eca91d3`, 2,007 bytes). Untracked from `main` by `9da1d75` on 2 September;
still present unchanged on nine unmerged branches. Reproduced here in full so
that it survives any merge. Recover the original directly with
`git show fa32b60:.agents/STATUS.md`.

**Do not act on the commands in the text below.** It is a historical record.
Its `git reset --hard 8514727` line was accurate when written and is now
obsolete and destructive: `8514727` predates the commit that added the
2,880-line WorkOS plan, which is on `main` via PR #29.

# STATUS — Wheelhouse EPOS

**State:** phase one merged-ready; architecture stage one **set up, not started**
**Branch:** `feat/shadcn-foundation` (PR #9, CI green)
**Updated:** 2026-08-31

> This directory is gitignored volatile scratch and an earlier copy of it was
> destroyed mid-session. Durable records live in `docs/`. Do not put anything
> here that matters.

## Start here if you are a fresh session

Read `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-31-architecture-stage-1.md`. It has the
exact commands. Short version — from a new branch off master, with docker up:

```
Workflow({ name: 'wheelhouse-architecture-stage-1' })
```

Decisions that govern the work: `docs/decisions/2026-08-31-frontend-platform.md`.

## Done

- **`fix/cross-tenant-login-scope` merged** (PR #4). Master had no CI at all
  before that; it also carried the fix scoping every `logins` write to the
  caller's shop.
- **Frontend phase one** — PR #9, CI green on run `33396591409` (89/89 tests,
  41s). Vite 8 + React 19 + TS + Tailwind 4.3.3 + a shadcn registry with four
  enforcement gates, each mutation-tested. Nothing user-visible changed.

## Next

Architecture stage one, via the workflow above. Six ceilings; the seventh
(managed Postgres with PITR and a rehearsed restore) is infrastructure and is
deliberately excluded — a human owns it.

## Open items needing Mark

1. `--status-complete-paid-ink` — held back on purpose, needs sign-off.
2. Dark-mode palette in `src/styles/theme.css` was invented during the scaffold
   with no design approval. Nothing renders it yet.
3. Registry primitives use native `<dialog>` rather than Radix, because
   `@radix-ui/*` was not installed. Should be an explicit decision.
4. `design/workos-auth-migration` carries duplicate copies of two commits from
   when the working tree switched branches mid-session.
   `git reset --hard 8514727` cleans it. Mark's branch, Mark's call.
5. After stage one lands: repoint the `app` healthcheck in `docker-compose.yml`
   at `/healthz`.

## Provenance of the current `.agents/STATUS.md`

Moved out of `STATUS.md` on 6 September 2026 when the file passed its
8,000-byte cap. Verbatim as it stood there:

This file replaces Mark's `.agents/STATUS.md` (`fa32b60`, 31 Aug, blob
`0eca91d3`). That version is still on nine unmerged branches, where it is
identical everywhere. A merge of any of them will **silently** keep this file
and drop Mark's with no conflict — so its live content was carried forward here
by hand rather than left to git. Recover the original with:
`git show fa32b60:.agents/STATUS.md`

## Merged work, 30 August - 2 September 2026

Moved out of `STATUS.md` on 6 September 2026 when the file passed its
8,000-byte cap. Verbatim as it stood there. Full list any time:
`gh pr list --state merged -L 100`.

**Carried forward verbatim from Mark's file (`fa32b60`):**

- **`fix/cross-tenant-login-scope` merged** (PR #4). Master had no CI at all
  before that; it also carried the fix scoping every `logins` write to the
  caller's shop.
- **Frontend phase one** — PR #9, CI green on run `33396591409` (89/89 tests,
  41s). Vite 8 + React 19 + TS + Tailwind 4.3.3 + a shadcn registry with four
  enforcement gates, each mutation-tested. Nothing user-visible changed.

**Since (30 Aug - 2 Sep):**

- **Storefronts and checkout** — per-shop public storefronts (#1), Shopify
  checkout (#2), owner preview button (#3). Plans archived (#6).
- **Platform and infra** — Cloudflare Tunnel assumption dropped (#8), CI push
  trigger on main (#10), architecture stage-one workflow set up (#11), README
  made accurate (#12), ESLint stopped parsing workflow files (#26).
- **Workshop / diary** — booking portal data leak closed (DS-7, #19), server
  enforces diary rules (DS-8, #20), first workshop tests (DS-9, #21), service
  catalogue and labour lines (JOB-12/13, #24).
- **Design** — audit findings, shared tokens, WCAG contrast gate (#14).
- **Research and direction** — business/market research (#7), business plan and
  workshop-first direction (#13), wedge decision (#22) and plan reconciliation
  (#23), Book My Bike In teardown + Hubtiger research (#25), Lightspeed R-Series
  as first platform (#27).
- **WorkOS auth** — design spec and 2,880-line plan on `main` (#29, replaces
  #15). Approved, not implemented.
- **Process** — `.agents/STATUS.md` untracked (#28), then rebuilt and tracked.

## Housekeeping notes

Moved out of `STATUS.md` on 7 September 2026 when the file passed its
8,000-byte cap after the stage-one merge. Verbatim as it stood there.

- `origin/design/workos-auth-migration` (0dad2a4, 31 Aug) is the superseded
  pre-rebuild branch. Its content is safe: the 2,880-line plan and 760-line
  spec are both on `main`, byte-identical, merged via PR #29. Deleting the
  stale remote branch is a judgement call nobody has made.

## Open design items carried from Mark's 31 August STATUS.md

Moved out of `STATUS.md` on 7 September 2026 when the file passed its
8,000-byte cap. STILL OPEN — moved for space, not resolved. Verbatim.

Items 1-4 are carried forward verbatim in substance from Mark's own STATUS.md
(`fa32b60`, 31 Aug) and re-verified against the tree on 2026-09-03.

1. **`--status-complete-paid-ink` needs sign-off.** Held back on purpose.
   Still unapplied and now inconsistent: `public/tokens.css:75` has the fixed
   `#4d7364`, `src/styles/theme.css:84` still has `#6b9484` at 3.21 contrast,
   which fails AA. `docs/decisions/2026-08-31-frontend-platform.md:68` records
   it as NOT applied.
2. **Dark-mode palette** in `src/styles/theme.css` was invented during the
   scaffold with no design approval. Nothing renders it yet. Design direction
   is Mark's to approve.
3. **Registry primitives use native `<dialog>`** rather than Radix, because
   `@radix-ui/*` was not installed. Should be an explicit decision, not a
   default that hardened.
