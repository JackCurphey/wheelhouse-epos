# STATUS — Wheelhouse EPOS

**Mark is on:** WP-0.4: 57 of 161 routes moved (5 Oct). Next, a spec for
`server/lib/sales.js` with customers and sales (deferred Shopify pushes),
then image uploads and booking/portal; the dashboard needs Jack's
`currentShopToday`. Then WP-0.5. **#157** approved by Mark (5 Oct), for Jack to
update and merge; the types split (§4.3) waits on it.
**Jack is on:** WP-0.2's screens half merged (#164, 5 Oct); the stage
check waits for Mark's lines 4 and 6.
Ready alongside: #136 (Citrus Lime exports, not started) and #138 (card
machine: Stripe first, SumUp second, Paymentsense later, #174,
`docs/decisions/2026-10-05-card-payments-provider.md`), only Jack can do; reviewing Mark's
WP-0.4 pull requests; stage 0's stage check once lines 1–6 of §9 are in.
**Open for Jack:** drawings needed before WP-1.7: the trust-PIN "tap your
name" screen, and the "till only" pop-up's line for a Mechanic (WP-1.1 spec
§8); a Change requested badge on the job window (not drawn).

**Updated:** 2026-10-05. **Two people build at once** (Jack agreed to Mark's
split plan, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-04-release-2-two-person-split.md`,
PR #126): Mark takes the server half of each work package and all hosting;
Jack takes the screens and the whole workshop. STATUS and the build board are
updated by **one status pull request a day**, not by every feature pull
request (`CLAUDE.md`, rule 7).

**The build started 4 Oct** (Jack). The record of 4–5 Oct's planning
merges (#126, #110–#112, #144, #146, #153, #154, #124, #157's state) is in
ARCHIVE, "Moved from STATUS on 2026-10-05 (evening)".

## Where the build stands

Stage 0 (split plan §9). Done: line 1 (WP-0.1); line 2 (WP-0.2 server
half, #148, 5 Oct); line 3 (STATUS trim, #149, 5 Oct); line 5 (WP-0.2 screens, #164,
5 Oct). In progress: line 4
(Mark, WP-0.4: route-list test #150, migration checks and
`scripts/new-db.sh` #151, screen-trace reads the route files #152, route
moves #155 suppliers, #156 purchase orders, #158 label settings and shop
theme, #159 website and Shopify, #160 sites and tills, #162 team, #165
printing and messages, #167 sign-in, #168 products; guards that moved files
and `server.js` define every name they use and import nothing unused,
#155 and #158). Waiting: line 6 (Mark, WP-0.5; waits for line 4); line 7
(Jack, the stage check; waits for lines 1–6). Stage 1 starts only after
line 7. Planning fixes before stage 1: #131, #132, #133 closed; #141 in
#157 (approved by Mark, for Jack to merge). #161 (the migration backstop missed a rename
that duplicates a number) is fixed by #166.

opens, edit its `BOARD` data block and republish (Jack, 3 Oct: he keeps it open
to see where we are).

## Open for Jack

- Release 2: the business-plan gate conflict (programme spec §5) is between
  Jack and Mark; Cycle to Work needs Jack's explanation; there is no official
  Wheelhouse logo file (designs show a LOGO slot — never invent one).
- Confirm piece 12's four controller rulings: an ordinary legacy-diary save
  keeps a customer's change request; dragging a job onto exactly its
  requested slot accepts it; every way a request ends clears it; the
  lock-held race tests are sound.
- The piece 6 memory risk (large booking bodies) must be decided before the
  booking route is publicly reachable (hosting not chosen).
- #169: three flaky tests in Jack's area (`tests/customer/details-screen.test.js:474`
  from #164, `tests/screens/diary-new-job.test.js`, `tests/browser/diary-waiting.spec.ts:100`);
  the first failed `main`'s CI on the #164 merge and passed on the next run.
- Review Mark's WP-0.4 pull requests after the fact (Mark, 5 Oct: they merge
  on green CI plus a fresh review while Jack is busy; each says so).
- `tests/screens/session.test.js:3` says `serializeSession` lives in
  `server.js`; it is in `server/routes/auth.js` now.
- Found in #148, not fixed: on a website address `/api/portal/*` returns the
  website's HTML (`decided-while-building.md`, Mark's lane), for WP-0.5.
- `timed_lead_minutes` isn't used in any customer confirmation yet.

## Moved to ARCHIVE

All in `ARCHIVE.md`, "Moved from STATUS on 2026-10-05 (WP-0.3)":

- Issue #116 record and its open walk questions for Jack (walk 10 L1, walk
  11 M3/L1, drawer wording, size gaps): "Older notes from the top of STATUS".
- Each journey's record, open notes and own canvas link: "Journey and
  walk-through paragraphs".
- Release 2 specs, names and Fjell: "Release 2 and the design system (27
  Sep, main session)". The 29 Sep list (d6, and unscheduled items such as
  WorkOS sign-in): "Next, in order (Jack, 29 Sep)".
- Fjell items, five parked diary items, other workstreams: "Open for Jack —
  the Fjell bullet…".
- Old checkouts, build method, helper notes, migrations 037 and 038: "Working
  notes moved out".

## Working notes for the next agent

- Route moves: a move, not a rewrite; `tests/route-files-defined.test.js`
  catches a name left undefined. A database per worktree:
  `scripts/new-db.sh <name>`.
- Jack wants plain English, numbered options with concrete trade-offs,
  mock-ups for anything visual, one question at a time. Merging: until the
  build starts, only when Jack says; after, as `CLAUDE.md` sets out. Always
  after CI passed on the PR's final commit.
- Tests: server tests pin the clock to 1 Sep 2026 (`WHEELHOUSE_TEST_CLOCK`;
  never add fixed test dates before it); customer tests need `npm run
  pretest` first; compare DOM query results with `assert.ok(x === null)`
  (`assert.equal` on a DOM node hangs ~60s on failure); `MonthCalendar` names
  days with a comma ("Monday, 5 October 2026").
- Environment: the app runs on `localhost:8080` (not 4000); Postgres via
  compose on port 5433 (not 5432); `npm run docker:down` keeps the volume, so
  use a scratch database to test migrations from empty; `npm test` hangs
  silently without compose Postgres up; a worktree needs its own `.env`
  (gitignored, doesn't travel) or every server-booting test fails with
  `ECONNREFUSED`.
- Deploy warning: back up any real shop database before deploying migration
  030 (it drops columns; there is no code-only rollback).
- Keep this file under 8 KB. Move finished-piece history to `ARCHIVE.md`
  rather than deleting it.
- House style (Jack, 3 Oct 2026): any PowerPoint or slide deck about this
  project is titled "Deez Nuts".
