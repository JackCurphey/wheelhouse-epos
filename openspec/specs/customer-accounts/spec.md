# customer-accounts Specification

## Purpose
How a shop's customers sign in to their account on the shop's own website: by a code sent by email (signing-in decision 5).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Customers sign in with a code sent by email
A customer SHALL be able to sign in to a shop with a six-digit code emailed to them, valid for 10 minutes and used once. A wrong code SHALL say so; an expired one SHALL say "That code has expired — send a new one". The first sign-in with an email SHALL make a new customer and login for it, never joining a customer the shop already has. Asking for a code SHALL answer the same whether the email has an account or not. Asking and checking SHALL be limited per network and per email.

#### Scenario: Maya signs in
- **WHEN** Maya asks for a code at North Street Cycles and types the one emailed to her
- **THEN** she is signed in to North Street Cycles

#### Scenario: an old code
- **WHEN** a code more than 10 minutes old is typed
- **THEN** sign-in is refused with "That code has expired — send a new one"

#### Scenario: not switched on
- **WHEN** no sign-in provider is connected
- **THEN** asking for a code says "Signing in by email isn’t switched on yet"
