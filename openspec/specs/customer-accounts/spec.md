# customer-accounts Specification

## Purpose
How a shop's customers sign in to their account on the shop's own website: by a code sent by email (signing-in decision 5).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Customers sign in with a code sent by email
A customer SHALL be able to sign in to a shop with a six-digit code emailed to them, valid for 10 minutes and used once. A wrong code SHALL say so; an expired one SHALL say "That code has expired — send a new one". The first sign-in with an email SHALL make a new customer and login for it, never joining a customer the shop already has. Asking for a code SHALL answer the same whether the email has an account or not. Asking and checking SHALL be limited per network and per email.

#### Scenario: Maya signs in
- **WHEN** Maya asks for a code at North Street Cycles and types the one emailed to her
- **THEN** she is signed in to North Street Cycles

#### Scenario: an old code
- **WHEN** a code more than 10 minutes old is typed
- **THEN** sign-in is refused with "That code has expired — send a new one"

#### Scenario: not switched on
- **WHEN** no sign-in provider is connected
- **THEN** asking for a code says "Signing in by email isn’t switched on yet"

### Requirement: The sign-in screens
The shop's sign-in page SHALL ask for an email ("Sign in to your account", "Email me a code"), then for the six-digit code ("Enter your code") in one box drawn as six that checks itself on the sixth digit, with "Send a new code" and "Use a different email". A wrong or expired code SHALL say so under the boxes. Once signed in, the page the sign-in link came from SHALL open when it is one of this shop's own pages, and the shop's booking page otherwise.

#### Scenario: Maya signs in from her booking
- **WHEN** Maya opens sign-in from her booking, asks for a code and types it
- **THEN** she is signed in and back on her booking

#### Scenario: an expired code
- **WHEN** the code she types has expired
- **THEN** "That code has expired — send a new one" shows under the boxes, and Send a new code stands out

#### Scenario: a link to somewhere else
- **WHEN** the sign-in link's page is another site or another shop's
- **THEN** after the code the shop's own booking page opens instead
